Yeah, well.

## Why the Aspie Automator name?

Hi. My name is Pete Carapetyan, and I write this site to give normal people a little bit of my perspective living "on the Autism Spectrum"

## Is an Autism diagnosis just BS?

Glad you asked!

Yes, like all issues or syndromes that are only diagnose-able by a set of behaviors, light variants of Autism could easily be called B.S. by anyone who believes (like I do) in our ability as individuals to rise above any deficits and just 'man up'.

So instead, I'll express it as a summary of my own experiences.

I'm probably as smart and certainly as sensitive as the next guy. I have feelings and love and annoyances just like you do. But after 6+ decades on the planet, I can absolutely tell you of a seemingly infinite series of event in my life where I just didn't _"get it"_ despite the fact that everyone around me gets it quite naturally.

I told my friend Boyd about my possible diagnosis earlier this year. His response was telling. Paraphrasing, for brevity: _"Well duh, Pete."_ 

As an experience, it can be quite maddening. So here's what I dug up on the apparent science behind it:

## Autism as Context Blindness

That's one of the books I got on the subject: "Autism as Context Blindness". Perhaps it's the easiest way to understand it?

If life - especially in a human or social setting - is about pattern recognition, apparently people like me get a score of "almost".

## You and I walk into a social situation together
Let's assume you and I walk into a social situation together.

I can read a social context just like a neuro-typical can. Except I'll probably miss some key parts that you won't miss.

Since I read the same context as you, I feel just as confident as you would. But since I missed one or more parts, I'm liable to feel falsely confident that I "got it" making you all the more puzzled because you might easily tell "No, Pete, you actually sorta didn't get it."

One could say that this is a little microcosm of the life of an Aspie.

I screw up, reading humans. A lot. Especially in interpersonal and business situations. Kinda sad, if it wasn't so funny. And then, to miss the mark with such brazen confidence!

## Sneaky misses
The above example of you and me skates by a bit of an Aspie reality. The truer description would be that we would both do fine in a typical situation. But I'll score just enough misses, over time, to lead me in a screwball or confusing direction just when everything seemed like it was OK.

So it wouldn't be you saying that I didn't get it like above. Instead, things get weird later because you and I might think we were on the same page and somewhere I make the wrong conclusion about something, and neither of us can figure out where or why.

"You mean you knew all along? I wrote the budget spreadsheet for that whole project - as if the guy was shooting straight with us!" I would ask you, surprised.

"Gosh Pete, I thought it was obvious, and you'd throw in an extra 30% just like we always do when we cover for what we both know that type does."

This is what drives Aspies to look to something - anything - for external help. Especially machines. At least, you can count on machines to work in consistent and predictable way.

## Austism and Automation/Computation

I've been working for decades now on a more computational view of life on our planet. Until I got a better understanding of what was driving this, I thought it was a personal insight stemming from my occupation as a software developer.

Now of course, it makes much more sense - in addition to everything else, I'm attempting to compensate for my autism, or the missing part of my personal observational capability.

## You and me: A scenario with automation:
Let's take me and you - again assuming you're neuro-typical. We both enter a situation, we both read it, and we both have decades of experience that tell us exactly what to do in this situation.

But here's the difference. You have every reason to believe that you can judge the situation and handle it appropriately. For you, computation is a stupid concept. What would you compute? What would you automate? Nothing. "I got this, Pete. Go away, for goodness sake, if you can't see what's in front of your face."

Not me. "Gosh, I already know that I can't feel confident, I've been in situations like this before." So I distrust every pattern and observation I'm [not] seeing, and instead look for some way of gathering more data, grinding through more calculations, comparing to more situations - anything to give me a chance to just not screw up this one situation like I might have screwed up previous similar.

It could be a business situation such as "Should i do business with this person?" Or even "How should I write this proposal?" Or it could be personal, such as meeting an old friend at a bar and saying something inappropriate, after not seeing him for a few years.

Over-compensating with automation and computation
You would find me trying to over-compensate in every way imagineable, and as a neuro-typical you're exhausted just thinking about it. For me? I don't know any other way, and it doesn't frustrate nearly as much as one more failure does. I'll write automation programs, to help me write automation programs :)

Screwing up social situations? That can be very frustrating. But adding more automation to an already over-compensated situtaion? No problem. What's the metric on ...? Oh wait...

So that's how the Aspie Automator site came to be.

Aspie is short for Aspergers, which is a term used for defining "high functioning autistic" people.

## What next?

Someday I might blog more on specific situations that neuro-typicals could find amusing.
